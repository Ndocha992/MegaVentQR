## Project Overview

**MegaVentQR** is a simple and efficient web application that enables event attendees to register by scanning a QR code. It's ideal for physical or hybrid events where quick registration and digital check-in are required. The system captures essential attendee data and logs the event attendance securely in the cloud.

**Use Case Example:**
- An attendee arrives at an event, scans a QR code displayed at the entrance, and is instantly registered in the system—no manual entry required.

### Key Features:
- ✅ QR Code-initiated registration
- ✅ Web-based, no mobile app needed
- ✅ Realtime database logging (Firebase)
- ✅ Simple, minimal interface for attendees
- ✅ Admin dashboard (optional future expansion)
